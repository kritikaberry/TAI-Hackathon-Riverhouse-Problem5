## ✨ Quick Start

Choose the tool that fits your workflow:

| Tool | Best For | Link |
|------|----------|------|
| **🔄 Data Pipeline** | Download & build the latest Master Dataset from scratch | [Open in Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCEmcRsECJjxkxj6UJQOqFn-3c7ulu5V/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **📊 Visualizations** | Generate charts & insights from your existing `AIID_Master_Dataset.xlsx` | [Open in Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nM53_u8GWCeAFzoSXLw8tXW74cHeMyDc/view?usp=drive_link) |
| **🌐 Live Dashboard** | Explore consolidated data interactively (no download needed) | [View Streamlit Dashboard](https://aiidsdatahouse.streamlit.app/) |

### How It Works
1. **Pipeline Notebook**: Visits the official AI Incident Database website → downloads the latest archive → cleans, deduplicates, and merges source files → exports a polished Excel workbook.
2. **Visualization Notebook**: Upload your Master Dataset → instantly generate trend charts, risk domain breakdowns, and harm analytics.
3. **Streamlit Dashboard**: Filter, search, and export insights through a user-friendly web interface.

## 📦 What's Included: Dataset Overview

The pipeline intelligently merges **5 source files** from the AI Incident Database using `Incident ID` as the primary key:

| Source File | Key Content | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `incidents.csv` | Titles, descriptions, involved entities | Core incident records |
| `MIT FutureTech` | Risk domains, intent, deployment timeline | Technical risk classification |
| `GMF (Goals, Methods & Failures)` | AI objectives, failure modes, technical analysis | Root-cause insights |
| `CSETv1` | Harm severity, affected sectors, geographic data | Policy & impact context |
| `duplicates.csv` | Duplicate record identifiers | Automated deduplication |

✅ **Output**: A single, well-structured `AIID_Master_Dataset.xlsx` with consistent formatting and enriched metadata.

## 🛠️ How to Customize (No Code Required!)

The pipeline is designed for easy maintenance. All configuration lives in **Cell 1: ⚙️ Configuration**.

### 🔁 If a source column is renamed:

# Update the COLUMNS mapping dictionary
`
COLUMNS = {
    "old_source_column_name": "master_column_name",  # ← Change left side only
    ...
}
`

### ➕ To add a new field:
1. Add the column to the relevant source dictionary in `COLUMNS`
2. Include it in the `MASTER_COLUMN_ORDER` list to control output sequence

### 🩺 Schema Health Check (Cell 4)
- Automatically detects missing or unexpected columns
- Warns *before* processing begins—no silent failures
- Helps you adapt quickly to AIID updates

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Always run Cell 4 first when updating the pipeline to validate compatibility.

## <a id="ask-a-question"></a>🤖 Ask a Question - Query the Database with Custom LLM

- Ask in plain English; no SQL needed  
- Gemini maps your question to dataset filters/columns. Any user from any background can query as per their requirement. For instance, "What is the highest concern in ai incidents with impact to humans?". 
- Shows results in a data table + SQL query
